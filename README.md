# Jerry Leong's Portfolio

## Description

Welcome to my portfolio.

This webpage was built and designed by me to display my 
past projects -- *will add soon* --.

In this portfolio
you will find a short introduction of myself and why I 
chose the journey of software development.

This portfolio
also includes a working navigation section on the top
that is fully functional and will link you to a contacts page
where you can sumbit your name, email, and a message.
